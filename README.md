# Font Awesome Icons for LMS

This repository provides a comprehensive reference for **Font Awesome 4 icons**, tailored for use within LMS (Learning Management Systems) like Moodle. It demonstrates how to integrate Font Awesome icons with Bootstrap components, showcasing examples of using icons in headings, buttons, and tables. The main HTML file, `Font-Awesome-Icons-for-LMS.html`, serves as a guide for using these icons effectively within an LMS environment.

## Features

- **Extensive Icon List**: A table featuring various icons from Font Awesome 4, including each iconâ€™s preview, name, and corresponding HTML code.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Guidance on using `aria-hidden`, `role="img"`, and other attributes to ensure icons are accessible and screen-reader-friendly.
- **Bootstrap Examples**: Demonstrations of how to incorporate icons into Bootstrap-styled elements like buttons and headings.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the HTML File**:
    - Download `Font-Awesome-Icons-for-LMS.html` from this repository to view and interact with the full icon list.
2. Copy the HTML code into your LMS course site using the editor
3. Save and review the page to determine what is accessible from the Font Awesome Icon set.

## Usage

### Adding Icons
1. **Using the `<i>` Element**:
    - Each icon is represented by an `<i>` element with specific classes, such as:
      ```html
      <i class="fa fa-glass" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      ```
2. **Bootstrap Integration**:
    - For consistent styling, wrap icons within Bootstrap components. For example, a button:
      ```html
      <button class="btn btn-primary">
          <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Like
      </button>
      ```

### Accessibility Considerations
- **aria-hidden**: Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons to hide them from screen readers.
- **role="img"**: Use `role="img"` and `aria-label` for icons that convey specific meaning or functionality.
